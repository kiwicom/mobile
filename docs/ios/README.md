## Test playground app

Open the project in XCode (use `reactNativeApp.xcworkspace`). Make sure you have `RNNativePlayground - Release` scheme selected before running. It will run the app from `jsbundle`.

### Running from the packager - Debug mode

Running the app from the packager allows you to reload the Javascript code instantly, every time you make changes in your code.

1. To run `KiwiHotels` module with the packager, change the schema for `RNNativePlayground - Debug`

2. Then run the packager from the root of this repo:

```bash
yarn start
```

_NOTE_: Clean build directory (⇧⌘K in XCode) if you are switching directly from `Debug` to `Release` schema.
