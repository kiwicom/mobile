All changes to the code must be send via pull request (PR) and this PR is always merged (integrated) by merge master. The code may be reviewed by other person (recommended) but agreement from merge master should be enough. Please try to at least very quickly review PRs of your colleagues to make sure you understand what's happening (and maybe you'll spot some mistakes).

Merge master is responsible for:

- integrating PR into master branch flawlessly
- taking care of overall picture of the application design
- initializing bigger changes in application structure (because of increasing technical debt in some part)
