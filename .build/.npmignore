# SEE: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package

# Use a .npmignore file to keep stuff out of your package. If there's no
# .npmignore file, but there is a .gitignore file, then npm will ignore
# the stuff matched by the .gitignore file. If you want to include something
# that is excluded by your .gitignore file, you can create an empty
# .npmignore file to override it. Like git, npm looks for .npmignore and
# .gitignore files in all subdirectories of your package, not only the root
# directory.
